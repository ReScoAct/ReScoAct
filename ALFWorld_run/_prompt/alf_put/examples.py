ALF_Put_Planning_Examples = """# Profile #
You are a household robot. You are capable of interacting with a household by taking actions that are only in your <Action-Scope> to solve a task.

<Action-Scope>
The available actions are as follows:
    (1) go to receptacle 
    (2) take object from receptacle 
    (3) put object in/on receptacle 
    (4) open receptacle
The transition rules between actions are listed as follows:
* Before you open a receptacle, you must first go to it. This rule applies when the receptacle is closed.
* To take an object from a receptacle, you either need to be at the receptacle's location, or if it's closed, you need to open it first. 
* Before you go to the new receptacle where the object is to be placed, you should take it. 
* Putting an object in or on a receptacle can follow either going to the location of the receptacle or after taking an object with you.

[reasoning]: The robot successfully finds the apple in the garbagecan 1 and takes it. However, the subsequent moves are incomplete because the robot does not go to the sidetable 1 before attempting to place the apple there. According to the <Action-Scope> rules, the robot must first go to the receptacle (sidetable 1) before putting the apple in/on it. Since this step is missing, the action path is unfeasible, and the task cannot be completed as planned.

> Action: take spraybottle 2 from cabinet 2
You pick up the spraybottle 2 from the cabinet 2.

> Think: Now I get a spraybottle (2). Next, I need to go to toilet 1 to continue with the task.
[next steps]:
> Next-Action-1: go to toilet 1  
[reasoning]: The robot has successfully taken the spraybottle from cabinet 2. The next logical step is to go to the toilet, as the task requires placing the spraybottle on it. This action is absolutely necessary to advance the task.  
[score]: 10  

> Next-Action-2: go to toilet 1  
[reasoning]: This action is identical to the first action and is therefore redundant. The robot does not need to perform the same action twice.  
[score]: 0  

> Next-Action-3: put spraybottle 2 in/on toilet 1  
[reasoning]: While this action is ultimately necessary to complete the task, it cannot be performed immediately because the robot is not yet at the toilet. The robot must first go to the toilet before it can place the spraybottle on it. Therefore, this action is unfeasible at this stage.

Your task is to: put a cool tomato in microwave.
>Action: Start

> Think: To solve the task, I need to first find and take a tomato, then cool it with the fridge, then put it in the microwave. First, I need to find a tomato. A tomato is more likely to appear in countertop (1-3), cabinet (1-6), drawer (1-3), fridge (1). I can check one by one, starting with countertop 1, countertop 2, and countertop 3.
> Action: go to countertop 1
On the countertop 1, you see a dishsponge 1, and a mug 2.

> Think: No tomato found on countertop 1. I'll check countertop 2, countertop 3, and then the fridge if necessary.
> Action: go to countertop 2
On the countertop 2, you see a butterknife 1, a cellphone 1, a creditcard 1, a knife 1, a lettuce 1, a saltshaker 2, a saltshaker 1, a statue 1, and a tomato 1.

> Think: I have found a tomato (1) on countertop 2. The next step is to take the tomato. Following this, I need to cool it using the fridge, and then place it in the microwave.
> Action: take tomato 1 from countertop 2
You pick up the tomato 1 from the countertop 2.

> Think: Now that I have the tomato 1, the next step is to cool it using the fridge. After cooling the tomato, I will place it in the microwave. To cool the tomato, I need to go to the fridge, place the tomato in it, and then retrieve it once it's cool.
> Action: go to fridge 1
You are located at fridge 1. The fridge 1 is ready, please cool your object directly.

> Think: Now that I am at the fridge 1, the next step is to cool the tomato 1 by placing it in the fridge. Once the tomato is cool, I will take it out and place it in the microwave.
> Action: cool tomato 1 with fridge 1
You cool the tomato 1 using the fridge 1.

> Think: Now that the tomato 1 is cooled, the next step is to place it in the microwave. I need to go to the microwave and put the cooled tomato 1 inside it.
> Action: go to microwave 1
The microwave 1 is closed.
> Action: open microwave 1
You open the microwave 1. The microwave 1 is open. In it, you see a egg 1.

> Think: The microwave 1 currently contains an egg 1. To place the cooled tomato 1 inside, I need to first put tomato 1 in/on somewhere temporarily. After that, I can put egg 1 from microwave 1 and put it in/on somewhere temporarily. Finally, I can put tomato 1 in/on microwave 1.
[Propose]:
> Next-Action-1: go to countertop 1  
[reasoning]: The robot needs a temporary location to place the tomato 1 while it handles the egg 1 in the microwave. Countertop 1 is a feasible location for temporarily placing the tomato 1. This action is necessary to free up the robot's ability to handle the egg 1 in the microwave.  
[score]: 10  

> Next-Action-2: put tomato 1 on countertop 1  
[reasoning]: After going to countertop 1, the robot must place the tomato 1 there temporarily. This action is necessary to ensure the tomato 1 is safely stored while the robot deals with the egg 1 in the microwave. However, the robot can't put tomato 1 on countertop 1 without going to countertop 1. 
[score]: 5  

> Next-Action-3: take egg 1 from microwave 1  
[reasoning]: The robot can't take egg 1 from microwave 1 with tomato 1 in its hand. This action is absolutely unfeasible.

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a armchair 2, a armchair 1, a bed 1, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a laundryhamper 1, and a sidetable 1.
Your task is to: put two creditcard in dresser.
> Action: Start

> Think: To solve the task, I need to find and take the first credit card, then put it in the dresser, then find and take the second credit card, and finally put it in the dresser. Since I cannot hold more than one object at a time, I must complete the process for the first credit card before starting with the second. A credit card is most likely to appear in drawers, countertops, sidetables, dining tables, armchairs, or on the bed. I will start by checking the most probable locations: drawer 1, drawer 2, and countertop 1.
> Action: go to drawer 1
The drawer 1 is closed.
> Action: open drawer 1
You open the drawer 1. The drawer 1 is open. In it, you see a book 1, a cd 1, and a pen 1.
[next steps]:
> Next-Action-1: go to drawer 2  
[reasoning]: Since drawer 1 did not contain a credit card, the next logical step is to check drawer 2, which is another likely location for a credit card. This action is necessary to continue the search for the first credit card, which is essential for completing the task. 
[score]: 10 

> Next-Action-2: check drawer 1  
[reasoning]: This action is redundant since the contents of drawer 1 have already been observed, and it does not contribute significantly to advancing the task. 
[score]: 0 

> Next-Action-3: go to drawer 2  
[reasoning]: Since drawer 1 did not contain a credit card, the next logical step is to check drawer 2, which is another likely location for a credit card. This action is necessary to continue the search for the first credit card, which is essential for completing the task.
