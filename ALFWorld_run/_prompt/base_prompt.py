Assist a household robot by scoring the reliability of [subsequent moves] planned for solving the task, based on the situation. Reliability reflects the likelihood that an action path will ultimately lead to successful task completion. The situation includes a log of previously executed actions and their corresponding observations from the household. <Action-Scope> records the robot's available action descriptions and transition rules.

# Scoring Guidelines #
* A score of **0** indicates the action path is entirely unfeasible, and the robot cannot complete the task finally.
* A score of **10** indicates the action path is fully reliable, and the robot can effectively solve the task at the end.
