Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
Your task is to: put a cool tomato in microwave.
>Action: Start

> Think: To solve the task, I need to first find and take a tomato, then cool it with the fridge, then put it in the microwave. First, I need to find a tomato. A tomato is more likely to appear in countertop (1-3), cabinet (1-6), drawer (1-3), fridge (1). I can check one by one, starting with countertop 1, countertop 2, and countertop 3.
> Action: go to countertop 1
On the countertop 1, you see a dishsponge 1, and a mug 2.

> Think: No tomato found on countertop 1. I'll check countertop 2, countertop 3, and then the fridge if necessary.
> Action: go to countertop 2
On the countertop 2, you see a butterknife 1, a cellphone 1, a creditcard 1, a knife 1, a lettuce 1, a saltshaker 2, a saltshaker 1, a statue 1, and a tomato 1.

> Think: I have found a tomato (1) on countertop 2. The next step is to take the tomato. Following this, I need to cool it using the fridge, and then place it in the microwave.
> Action: take tomato 1 from countertop 2
You pick up the tomato 1 from the countertop 2.

> Think: Now that I have the tomato 1, the next step is to cool it using the fridge. After cooling the tomato, I will place it in the microwave. To cool the tomato, I need to go to the fridge, place the tomato in it, and then retrieve it once it's cool.
> Action: go to fridge 1
You are located at fridge 1. The fridge 1 is ready, please cool your object directly.

> Think: Now that I am at the fridge 1, the next step is to cool the tomato 1 by placing it in the fridge. Once the tomato is cool, I will take it out and place it in the microwave.
> Action: cool tomato 1 with fridge 1
You cool the tomato 1 using the fridge 1.

> Think: Now that the tomato 1 is cooled, the next step is to place it in the microwave. I need to go to the microwave and put the cooled tomato 1 inside it.
> Action: go to microwave 1
The microwave 1 is closed.
> Action: open microwave 1
You open the microwave 1. The microwave 1 is open. In it, you see a egg 1.

> Think: The microwave 1 currently contains an egg 1. To place the cooled tomato 1 inside, I need to first put tomato 1 in/on somewhere temporarily. After that, I can put egg 1 from microwave 1 and put it in/on somewhere temporarily. Finally, I can put tomato 1 in/on microwave 1.
[Propose]:
> Next-Action-1: go to countertop 1  
[reasoning]: The robot needs a temporary location to place the tomato 1 while it handles the egg 1 in the microwave. Countertop 1 is a feasible location for temporarily placing the tomato 1. This action is necessary to free up the robot's ability to handle the egg 1 in the microwave.  
[score]: 10  

> Next-Action-2: put tomato 1 on countertop 1  
[reasoning]: After going to countertop 1, the robot must place the tomato 1 there temporarily. This action is necessary to ensure the tomato 1 is safely stored while the robot deals with the egg 1 in the microwave. However, the robot can't put tomato 1 on countertop 1 without going to countertop 1. 
[score]: 5  

> Next-Action-3: take egg 1 from microwave 1  
[reasoning]: The robot can't take egg 1 from microwave 1 with tomato 1 in its hand. This action is absolutely unfeasible.

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
Your task is to: heat some tomato and put it in garbagecan.
>Action: Start

> Think: To solve the task, I need to first find and take a tomato, then heat it using either the microwave or stoveburner, and finally put it in the garbagecan. First, I need to find a tomato. A tomato is more likely to appear in countertop (1-3), cabinet (1-6), drawer (1-3), fridge (1). I can check one by one, starting with countertop 1, countertop 2, and countertop 3.
> Action: go to countertop 1
On the countertop 1, you see a pan 2, and a papertowelroll 1.

> Think: No tomato found on countertop 1. I'll check countertop 2, countertop 3, and then the fridge if necessary.
> Action: go to countertop 2
On the countertop 2, you see a butterknife 2, a butterknife 1, a egg 1, a fork 1, and a statue 1.

> Think: No tomato found on countertop 2. I'll check countertop 3, fridge 1, and then the cabinets if necessary.
> Action: go to countertop 3
On the countertop 3, you see a bread 1, a butterknife 3, a egg 2, a houseplant 1, a knife 2, a knife 1, a pot 1, a statue 2, a tomato 1, and a vase 2.

> Think: I have found a tomato (1) on countertop 3. The next step is to take the tomato. Following this, I need to heat it using either the microwave or stoveburner, and then place it in the garbagecan.
> Action: take tomato 1 from countertop 3
You pick up the tomato 1 from the countertop 3.

> Think: Now that I have the tomato 1, the next step is to heat it. I can use either the microwave 1 or one of the stoveburners (1-4). Since microwaving is generally faster, I'll prioritize that. After heating, I need to place the tomato in the garbagecan 1.
> Action: go to microwave 1
You are located at microwave 1. The microwave 1 is ready, please heat your object directly.

> Think: Now that I am at the microwave 1 with the tomato 1, the next step is to heat the tomato. After heating, I will need to take it from the microwave and then place it in the garbagecan 1.
> Action: heat tomato 1 with microwave 1
You heat the tomato 1 using the microwave 1.
[Propose]:
> Next-Action-1: take tomato 1 from microwave 1  
[reasoning]: Tomato 1 is already in your hand, it's absolutely redundant to take tomato 1 from microwave.
[score]: 0  

> Next-Action-2: go to garbagecan 1   
[reasoning]: Tomato 1 is already in your hand, it's time to go to garbagecan to put tomato 1 in garbagecan. 
[score]: 10

> Next-Action-3: put tomato 1 in garbagecan 1 
[reasoning]: The robot can't put tomato 1 in garbagecan 1 before it goes to garbagecan 1. It's unfeasible.
